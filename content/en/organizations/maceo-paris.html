    <p>Maceo, cooking by heart</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The French love to cook. When they're not making it, they're eating it. Or talking about it. Or they invent new ways to cook better. Claire does it all:  “The Art de la Table of the 21ᵉ century can no longer be reduced to decoration. Tomorrow's tableware must also become a useful, intelligent tool.” Armed with this conviction and its patented technology, elegantly encapsulated at the heart of its products, it revolutionizes our plates by keeping them hot for 45 minutes, without re-cooking the food. Of course, it also keeps them cold - without spoiling the mood! Because conviviality is a very French recipe, it can be enjoyed with a great deal of know-how and a touch of innovation. </p>
