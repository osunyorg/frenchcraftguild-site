    <p>Design of ceramic emotions</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Trained in the applied arts at leading Parisian schools, Elsa Dinerstein designs and creates porcelain and stoneware collections. Combining excellent craftsmanship and the search for new materials, Elsa develops an experimental and spontaneous approach in her studio, creating one-off pieces and limited series in line with her artistic orientations. But if each piece is a blend of traditional techniques and multi-inspired design, it remains a guarantee of excellence and uniqueness: the nuances, the traces of the hand and the spirit of the craftsman, reinvented with each gesture.</p>
