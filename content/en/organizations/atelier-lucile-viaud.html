    <p>  <br>"Ashes to ashes. Dust to light"How do you give organic waste a second life? Lucile knows. By exploring the links between science, design and craft, this young designer develops materials that are rich in meaning and respectful of the environment.Aware of the role designers have to play in preserving and enhancing our natural resources, this enthusiastic designer opens all the doors afforded by her field of research, and succeeds in offering a global experience around glass: whether from the sea or the land, it reveals the abundance and aesthetic diversity made possible by different species, origins and regions, and can be recycled ad infinitum.As everything flows harmoniously together, she also creates her own Ostraco collections, inspired by the region and its heritage, and designed according to local know-how. The first - or last? - manufacturer of 100% French glass, Ostraco offers a singular journey linking our history to our future.</p>
