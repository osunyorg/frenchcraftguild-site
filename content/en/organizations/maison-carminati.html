    <p>  <br>After years of designing unique residences in the United States and Europe, Anne Carminati launches her interior textile brand with a clear vision: offering exclusive collections, made to order, that celebrate the best of French craftsmanship. Its brand is rooted in a passion for high quality materials and the know-how that raises interiors to the rank of art.Designed in its Parisian studio and meticulously manufactured by skilled artisans, the collections tell a story of exquisite textures and sophisticated colour palettes inspired by France's rich cultural heritage. The Anne Carminati House represents a timeless and uncompromising luxury: custom craft, combining rare materials and exceptional finishes and allowing decorators and architects the freedom to customize each room - bed linen, bath linen and table linen, as well as thrown and cushions - from drawing to embroidery.</p>
