    <p>Secular expertise for ephemeral creations</p>

    <p>  <br>When you push open the heavy door of Procédés Chénel, you instantly forget about the machines, the 75 patents and the R&D. Like a return to childhood, where the material happily submits to the whims of the most fanciful creators, we admire, touch and are surprised to play with the thousands of combinations that paper offers. Ancient but not dusty, traditional but resolutely modern, parchment has come a long way. Thanks to the ingenuity and complicity of a father and daughter, today it rivals the most high-tech solutions. From prototype to mastered production run, ideas are embodied in partitions, ceilings or lighting fixtures... By bringing branches, trades and even countries into dialogue, this multi-platform family business creates inspired, phenomenal and unique works of art.</p>
