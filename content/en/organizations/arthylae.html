    <p>The art of sublimating matter</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Arthylae is a French company specializing in hot-molded glass, feathers, precious wood and metal. “The art of sublimating matter” is the very essence of Arthylae, whose name evokes both art and Hylé, the Greek word for matter. Thanks to its expertise in an infinite range of techniques, textures and finishes, Arthylae is a veritable studio of know-how and innovation, where exclusive pieces are designed, conceived and sculpted, all in transparency and light. The result is decorative and architectural panels, lighting fixtures and decorative pieces made by hand and on demand, as close as possible to needs and resources. To offer ever more creative and eco-responsible solutions, Pascale Lesage and Aurélien Birebent don't hesitate to push back the boundaries and imagine collections hybridizing materials and shapes. Exceptional craftsmanship, 100% French, loud and clear, is both the promise and the signature of this high-energy company.</p>
