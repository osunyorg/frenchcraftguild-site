    <p>Murano glass, French style</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A French brand of Murano glass creations, Milodina has been exploring all the secrets of Italian craftsmanship and craftsmanship since 2016 to create unique pieces. Interior architect, the founder of Milodina, Michèle Richer, has worked for more than 20 years for a large Parisian house specialized in this field. The strong and privileged ties forged with the Italian glassmakers allow him to become an ambassador and to offer a tailor-made service to enhance the interiors thanks to a creativity of excellence, heir to ancestral gestures. Because in Venice there are as many techniques of making and blowing glass as workshops! A true heritage combining tradition and innovation through processes, materials and colours whose variations are endless... A privileged expression field, for whom masters these rare repertoires, and excels, like Michèle, in grasping its prodigious modernity.</p>  <p> PROTOTYPE  <br> Seat  <br>This prototype was produced as part of a 400 x 120 cm custom tabletop project. For safety and technical issues, MILODINA has combined industrial safety glass with traditional hand-painted "painting" based on glass powder.  The particular graphics had to be adapted to the proportions of table XL.</p>
