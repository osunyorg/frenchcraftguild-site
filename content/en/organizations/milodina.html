    <p>Murano glass, French style</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A French brand of Murano glass creations, Milodina has been exploring all the secrets of Italian craftsmanship and know-how to create unique pieces since 2016. An interior designer, Milodina founder Michèle Richer worked for over 20 years for a major Parisian house specializing in this field. The strong, privileged links she has forged with Italian glassmakers have enabled her to become their ambassador, offering a tailor-made service to enhance interiors with the finest creativity, heir to ancestral gestures. For in Venice, there are as many glass-blowing techniques as there are workshops! A veritable heritage blending tradition and innovation through processes, materials and colors whose variations are infinite... A privileged field of expression for those who have mastered these rare repertoires and, like Michèle, excel in capturing their prodigious modernity.</p>
