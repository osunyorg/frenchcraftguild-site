    <p>  <br>Milodina, a French brand specializing in Murano glass creations, explores all the secrets of Italian craftsmanship and expertise to produce unique pieces. Michèle Richer, the founder of Milodina and an interior designer, has been working with Murano's glassmakers and mirror makers for over 26 years. The strong and privileged ties she has forged with Italian glassmakers have enabled her to become their ambassador and offer a tailor-made service to enhance interiors through creative excellence, inherited from ancestral techniques. In Venice, there are as many glassmaking and glassblowing techniques as there are workshops! A true heritage combining tradition and innovation through processes, materials, and colors with infinite variations... A privileged field of expression for those who master these rare skills and, like Michèle, excel at capturing their prodigious modernity.</p>
