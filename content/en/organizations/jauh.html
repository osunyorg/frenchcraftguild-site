    <p>Handcrafted design from wood</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Graduates of the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, Henri Danzin and Charles de Dainville founded JAÙH in 2023 to create a new kind of design, one in which the artisan is as much a part of the creative process as the manufacturing one. Through seven-day “design sprint” residencies, JAÙH offers one collection per year, comprising up to nine pieces of furniture. Each collection is unique, made of solid French wood and NFT-certified, with a limited shelf life and will never be reissued. By opting for a production-on-demand approach and micro-series, with traditional, screwless and repairable assemblies, JAÙH aims to constantly renew itself. But above all, by producing only what is necessary, the duo aligns itself with the capabilities and culture of the small artisan businesses with which it collaborates, and minimizes its environmental impact.</p>
