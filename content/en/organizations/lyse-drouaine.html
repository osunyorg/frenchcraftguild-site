    <p>  Weaving and Luminous Tapestry  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Lyse Drouaine creates luminous textiles for interior design. The artist and textile designer has developed an innovative weaving and tapestry technique in which diffusing optical fiber is interwoven with natural fibers: wool, cotton, linen, hemp, abaca, silk, enameled copper, and more. Weaving light is a rare skill at the crossroads of traditional weaving techniques, Aubusson and Savonnerie tapestry, contemporary design, and lighting. The creations are integral elements of the architectural project, responding to the challenges of use, spatial perception, and visual comfort for the fields of architecture, design, hospitality, the service sector, residential, and wellness.  Illuminated wall coverings, partitions, furniture elements, integrated works, and custom-made devices are designed in close collaboration with partners, collaborators, and sponsors. The weavings are produced by Lyse Drouaine in Aubusson, or by partner workshops and manufacturers chosen for their excellence and expertise. Various LED lighting solutions integrated into the weavings ensure controlled and sustainable light diffusion. The ambient light emitted by the textiles creates a soft, soothing, and enveloping atmosphere.</p>
