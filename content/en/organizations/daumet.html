    <p>  <br>Daumet began with a revolutionary new eco-responsible material: the world's whitest gold. A combination of gold and tungsten, this new 18-carat alloy was discovered by a French microelectronics research team in which Cyrile Deranlot worked. Watchmaking, jewelry, goldsmithing and, in the longer term, chemistry, aeronautics and biotechnologies are all concerned by this precious metal, which is less expensive, ultra-resistant, non-allergenic and energy-efficient. With the creation of the Daumet start-up to exploit and develop the potential of this patented innovation, applications are multiplying, all of them promising: white gold plating is finally possible, in addition to yellow and pink, for finishing gold-plated jewelry and accessories. Innovative all-colour gilding on leather, feathers, wood, glass or silk... With a solid equivalent soon to be developed. At the crossroads of “ancestral know-how and modern technology with respect for future generations”, Daumet is a multi-faceted company, offering the opportunity to make materials and creations shine while preserving the environment...</p>
