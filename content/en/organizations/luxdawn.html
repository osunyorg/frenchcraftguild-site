    <p>  <br>Lyse Drouaine is an artist and founder of the LUXDAWN® design house. Since her training in traditional weaving at Esaa Duperré, she has been developing an innovative material based on textile and optical fibers. Today, this surprising and bewitching material has found its place in the design of privileged spaces. A genuine turnkey solution for architects, decorators and designers, it is the fruit of research carried out by the artist between Lyon, Cité de la lumière (The City of Light), and Aubusson, Cité de la tapisserie et des arts tissés (City of tapestry and woven arts). These two regions, with their age-old, complementary know-how, give her access to a network of partners, each expert in their own field: optics, mechanics and weaving. But technique also knows how to be discreet in the face of the poetry and emotion aroused by this “dawn of light”. It's all about letting yourself be carried away by the immutable, ephemeral spectacle of a radiant score composed of strands of cotton, wool, linen, silk and luminous fibers. The space-time offered by this new landscape becomes a support for infinite meditation.</p>
