    <p>  <br>A former professional surfer, Vincent Lartizien returned to France with a clear idea: hemp, a miracle plant whose benefits are only now being rediscovered, could become tomorrow's universal source of well-being: food, medicines, cosmetics, materials, textiles... this plant-based raw material meets so many human needs, in harmony with nature, that its potential for transformation seems infinite. From a blank sheet of paper, he started his business, driven by boundless energy and a deep conviction: to recreate a French industry, organized around research, from which the players, through their know-how, tenacity and inventiveness, could develop noble and healthy products, accessible to all. Step by step, Vincent is building a holistic model that can be reproduced in every region. So that soon, new materials - such as concrete or hemp plastic - will not only be good, but beautiful. “The role that this extraordinary fiber will play (and is already playing) in tomorrow's agriculture, tomorrow's industrial world and tomorrow's commerce is beyond our imagination. That's why an approach based on art, the sustainable, the harmonious, the beautiful, the useful... is essential. It's through these worlds that its true recognition must come!”</p>
