    <p>  <br>The repository of an ancestral technique enabling the automation of “damask” weaving, Le Jacquard Français has conquered the title of institution in the tableware landscape. Evoking the city of Damascus, a stage on the Silk Road, this fabric is renowned for its visible motifs on both the front and back. Weavers, knotters, warpers... crafts of excellence that have kept the heart of the historic production site in eastern France beating for generations. And yet, for over 100 years, the company's R&D has been revolutionizing its collections to achieve the extreme finesse of its designs, combined with the unique harmonies of its colors. After all, it was the company that dared to introduce color into household linen back in the 1970s, and that has continued to promote it all over the world ever since...</p>
