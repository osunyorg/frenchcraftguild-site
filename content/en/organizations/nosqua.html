    <p>Nosqua, from one glass two</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Craftsmen specialized in glass, Manon Fernandez and Gauthier Dietschi founded Nosqua with the aim of honoring French creation with exceptional objects, combining know-how and design. This meeting between a glass decorator and a product designer results in a vast field of exploration of the glass material, offering a new vision of the profession through bold processes or traditional techniques reinterpreted at the service of luminaires, walls or interior furniture.  By hand work such as reflection on short circuits, over-cycling or use, each product becomes timeless as soon as it is born.</p>
