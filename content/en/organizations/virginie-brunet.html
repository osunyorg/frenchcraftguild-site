    <p>Fullness and modesty of burnt wood</p>

    <p>  <br>Ébéniste d'art, Virginie Brunet specializes in restoring antique furniture and creating furniture, lighting and decorative objects in the spirit of Wabi-Sabi. She explores the ancestral Japanese techniques of Shou Sugi Ban (burnt wood technique) and Kintsugi (gold leaf repair) to sublimate the imperfections of wood. From a healer of objects to an insatiable creator who doesn't hesitate to self-train to give substance to her ideas, she brings matter to life by playing with light and shadow, black and gold, smooth and rough, simple and complex, necessary and superfluous. Unique, original pieces at the crossroads of craft, art and design.</p>
