    <p>  <br>Caroline Besse explores the sensitive vibration of colors, listening to the intensities that pass through materials, those of a rare medium and those of the perceptive body. She invents a material, blending the fluidity of Chinese ink and ground mineral paint on Japanese paper with Western processes. Her art is a hybrid between the gallery object and the bespoke fresco, unique pieces designed for a given space and to open up perception. Caroline has developed her expertise in traditional frescoes and painted decors by learning oriental techniques. For more than twenty years, she has integrated into her approach the environmental concerns that preoccupy our contemporaries. Respect and choice of natural materials - colors, binders, glues and papers - are consubstantial with her artistic approach.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Instagram</p>  <p>https://www.instagram.com/caroline.besse/</p>  <p> PROTOTYPE </p>  <p> Blob  <br>Here, lapis-lazuli, sugilite and mica are deposited on silk, brushed and sprinkled. The exploration of mineral granulometrics and their interaction with textile fibres opens up a field of textures and reflections, conceived as a novel vocabulary for future decorative and architectural applications.</p>
