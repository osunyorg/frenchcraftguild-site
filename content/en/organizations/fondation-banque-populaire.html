  <p>Since 1992, the Banque Populaire   National   Foundation, an instrument of patronage of the 14 Banques Populaires and their members, promotes individual initiative and supports  the success of artisans, musicians & people with disabilities.</p><p><strong>It was in 2013 that the Foundation chose to support artisans by creating a specific jury, a wink at the origins of the Banques Populaires. Artisans are distinguished both by their aesthetic vision, their exceptional experimental abilities and a sense of matter acquired alongside a recognized art craftsman or through a solid training. They are smugglers of ancestral techniques and crafts, while being resolutely focused on creation, innovation and hybridization.</strong></p>
