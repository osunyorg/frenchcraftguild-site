    <p>  <br>Lily Latifi is a passionate textile designer with more than 25 years' experience in creating tailor-made solutions for interior design. She distinguishes herself by a singular approach where discreet elegance blends with (re)fined functionality. Each project, thought through to the smallest detail, is part of an approach that is both artisanal and innovative. From the rigorous choice of French or German textiles to manufacturing carried out entirely in France, Lily Latifi is the embodiment of a committed designer, committed to proximity and control of the entire production chain.She is interested in all soft materials: textiles, paper, foam... However, her favorite material is 100% natural wool felt, which she tenderly describes as her “creative companion”. She appreciates its sensuality, suppleness and acoustic and thermal qualities, which make it an ideal medium for designing mobile partitions, wall coverings and acoustic suspensions that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Her works transform spaces: they gently separate, conceal without weighing down, and create a soothing atmosphere without ever sacrificing the beauty of the gesture.Lily Latifi's universe draws its inspiration from nature - starting with natural light, clouds and bare landscapes - which she translates into light, poetic drawings or embossed material prints. Thanks to her artistic sensibility and technical expertise, she breathes fresh air into the often standardized world of interior textiles and acoustics. Her creations don't just fulfill a function: they tell a story, that of an art of living with finesse and harmony. <br>Workshop/Showroom by appointment37 bis, rue de Montreuil</p>  <p>75011 Paris</p>  <p>+33 (0)1 42 23 30 86info@lilylatifi.com</p>
