    <p>Anaïs' dream windows</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Trained in the techniques of fresco and mosaic, Anaïs Landes chooses to take her subject off the ground to explore - thanks to light - colors and roughness, and thus make the decor mobile and participative of the space. This research takes her to the frontiers of techniques and know-how, notably through the collaboration of several craftsmen, but also through the creation of materials in which lime, marble powder and sand are mixed with pigments and dyes to obtain unique blends. Paradoxically profound surface work, somewhere between arts and crafts and works of art, with its subtle, sensual variations magnifying the textures of an emotion, the volumes of a landscape, the opalescent poetry of the multiple variations of a flash of daylight.</p>
