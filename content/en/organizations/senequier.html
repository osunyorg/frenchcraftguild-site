    <p>  <br>Jean-Baptiste Sénéquier is an industrial designer. His pragmatic, sober and exploratory design questions and reshapes the links between craft, industry and production intelligence in a changing world. By combining traditional or vernacular know-how and materials, sensitive exploration of algorithms and new manufacturing methods, he seeks to establish fertile and poetic dialogues capable of opening up multiple potentials for the creation of fair, sustainable products. For him, it's always a question of connecting the project as closely as possible with its roots and culture. Working on the development of contemporary aesthetics and writing that draw their origins from a given territory, and traverse the materials of histories in the making.</p>  <p> PROTOTYPE  <br> Test pieces  <br>This project revisits a </p>  <p>Château de Versailles</p>  <p>Boulle's dresser by turning away the uses of 3D printing. By forcing the software to generate as many structures as possible, the machine becomes an actress of creation and leaves its mark on the object. The prototypes tested the technical feasibility of the project.</p>
