    <p>Manufacture of type</p>

    <p>  <br>Maison Alivon is the world's oldest and last remaining manufacturer of bronze typefaces. Thanks to a unique spoon casting process, Maison Alivon creates the marking tools used by gilders, bookbinders, cabinetmakers, luthiers and even the greatest chocolatiers. Maison Alivon is heir to rare ancestral know-how and a family heritage handed down from generation to generation, thanks to a passion for bronze and its many expressions that has remained intact. Now driven by the talent and energy of Marion Saussier, Maison Alivon is no longer just a renowned manufacturer, but a place where designers and artists are rediscovering bronze, thanks to Marion's creativity and the hitherto unexplored perspectives offered by this metal as hard as it is sensitive. Maison Alivon Éditions was born of Marion Saussier's ability to capture the beauty that lies in each of the factory's “workshop memories” and turn it into an piece of art. Nothing is lost, everything is transformed. This is particularly true at Maison Alivon Éditions: it's a virtuous gamble, met as much by commitment as by natural creativity. Sublimating residual matter without altering its character makes this collection of  objets d'art , insider curiosities, unheard-of jewelry and exceptional everyday objects unique in its genre. In this singular universe, between heritage and innovation, Maison Alivon marks its passage with an elegant, masterful and generous gesture.</p>
