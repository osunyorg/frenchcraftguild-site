        <p>             Lily Latifi is a passionate textile designer with more than 25 years' experience in creating tailor-made solutions for interior design. She stand out by her unique way of blending discreet elegance with (re)fined functionality.   Lily carefully selects only the best performance materials to suit each project that she studies through to the smallest detail. She combines an artisanal and innovative approach to create textile solutions that meet needs in terms of luminosity, visibility, modularity, heat and acoustic comfort.     From the rigorous choice of French or German textiles to manufacturing carried out entirely in France, Lily Latifi is committed to a local and quality production of her works.  She is interested in all soft materials : textiles, paper, foam... However, her favorite material is 100% natural wool felt, which she tenderly describes as her "creative companion". She appreciates its sensuality, softness and acoustic and heat regulating qualities, which make it an ideal medium for designing mobile partitions, wall coverings and acoustic suspensions that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Her works transform spaces : they gently separate, conceal without weighing down, and create a soothing atmosphere without ever sacrificing the beauty of the gesture.  Lily Latifi's organic and minimal world is inspired by nature - starting with natural light, clouds and bare landscapes - which she translates into light, poetic drawings or embossed material prints. Thanks to her artistic sense and technical expertise, she breathes fresh air into the often standardized world of interior textiles and acoustics. Her creations don't just fulfill a function : they tell a story, that of an art of living with finesse and harmony.      </p>
