    <p>  <br>Lily Latifi is a French-Iranian designer. Her sensitivity to both her native country and elsewhere is reflected in each of her creations. For more than twenty years, she has maintained an intimate relationship with textiles and natural light. Together, they design thresholds, modulate passageways and compose imaginary landscapes. Lily designs and manufactures textile solutions for interior architecture, designed to meet the essential needs of living and working spaces: controlling light without extinguishing it, seeing without exposing oneself, modulating without partitioning, softening sound, and tempering heat. First and foremost a designer, Lily begins by listening to the material. She studies its intrinsic properties long before seeking to give it form. Although she is interested in all textiles, natural felt remains her favourite material because of its acoustic and thermal qualities, its sensuality and its flexibility, which she has learned to master over time. Flexible materials open up an infinite field of experimentation where function naturally gives way to expression.  Irregularities and technical surprises are welcomed into her research process. When they resonate graphically, Lily amplifies them, transforming them into artistic choices. She makes them part of her vocabulary, translating them into light, poetic drawings that are cut out, engraved, or printed in relief. The simplicity of her movable walls reflects her quest for accuracy. Evolving, understated and unobtrusive, they shape atmospheres. Discreet but present, they serve to promote well-being. For Lily Latifi, textiles are neither decoration nor ornament. They are poetry applied to architecture. <br>Workshop/Showroom by appointment 37 bis, rue de Montreuil</p>  <p>75011 Paris <br>  <br>+33 (0)1 42 23 30 86 info@lilylatifi.com</p>
