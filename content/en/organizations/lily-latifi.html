    <p>  <br>Lily Latifi is a passionate textile designer with more <br>than 25 years' experience in creating tailor-made solutions for interior <br>design. She stand out by her unique way of blending discreet elegance with <br>(re)fined functionality. </p>  <p>Lily carefully selects only <br>the best performance materials to suit each project that she studies through to <br>the smallest detail.  She combines an artisanal and innovative approach to create textile solutions that meet needs in terms of luminosity, <br>visibility, modularity, heat and acoustic comfort. From the rigorous choice of French or German textiles <br>to manufacturing carried out entirely in France, Lily Latifi is committed to a <br>local and quality production of her works. <br>  <br>She is interested in all soft <br>materials : textiles, paper, foam... However, her favorite material is <br>100% natural wool felt, which she tenderly describes as her "creative <br>companion". She appreciates its sensuality, softness and acoustic and heat <br>regulating qualities, which make it an ideal medium for designing mobile <br>partitions, wall coverings and acoustic suspensions that are both aesthetically <br>pleasing and functional.  Her works transform spaces : they gently separate, <br>conceal without weighing down, and create a soothing atmosphere without ever <br>sacrificing the beauty of the gesture.</p>  <p>Lily Latifi's organic and <br>minimal world is inspired by nature - starting with natural light, clouds and <br>bare landscapes - which she translates into light, poetic drawings or embossed <br>material prints.  Thanks to her artistic sense and technical expertise, she <br>breathes fresh air into the often standardized world of interior textiles and <br>acoustics. Her creations don't just fulfill a function : they tell a story, <br>that of an art of living with finesse and harmony.       <br>Workshop/Showroom by appointment 37 bis, rue de Montreuil</p>  <p>75011 Paris <br>  <br>+33 (0)1 42 23 30 86 info@lilylatifi.com</p>
