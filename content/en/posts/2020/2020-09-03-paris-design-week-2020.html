    <p>"Nature and Bauhaus"  <br>On the occasion of the 10th edition of the Paris Design Week, the French Craft had the pleasure of animating live on Instagram a dialogue between the designers and decorators Oscar Lucien Ono & Axel Huynh who presented on this occasion their collection of luminaires created for Art & Floritude.On Thursday, September 3rd, this conversation moderated by Magali Lancien for the French Craft allowed us to discover in exclusivity these magnificent creations inspired by Bauhaus and nature, followed by a cocktail in a prestigious historic site, a confidential address in the heart of the district of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.</p>  <p>   <br>It is said to be the largest private green space in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.It is said that the oldest tree in Paris remains there, on a land that has always been empty of all construction.We find that Colette lived there, that Racine died nearby.We whisper that secret passages still exist to connect the streets, and that the cellars communicate... That a Friendship Temple secretly nests "in the middle of the small wild park".This place is the Pré aux clercs, or Bois Visconti. In the 16th and 17th centuries, this fence served as a framework for many duels, but also as a hunting ground. Part of this fence was purchased by Queen Margot, who built a real park there.But it is especially in this enchanting and inspiring setting that the creators Oscar Lucien Ono and Axel Huynh naturally unveiled their latest collection of luminaires last night, around the theme "Nature & Bauhaus".</p>  <p>   <br>Revisit Live on Instagram (in French)</p>  <p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEsHJlVIoxI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==</p>  <p>Axel Huynh </p>  <p>https://axelhuynh.fr/</p>  <p>Oscar Ono & Maison Numéro 20</p>  <p>https://www.maisonnumero20.fr/home</p>  <p>Art et Floritude</p>  <p>https://artetfloritude.com/</p>
