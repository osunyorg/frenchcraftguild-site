    Launch of the French Craft digital showroom
  summary: >-
    <p>Library of projects, repertoire of gestures, showcase of excellence... The French Craft showroom presents a selection of rare creations, born of the encounter between exceptional know-how and innovation.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The French Craft's collective digital showroom is first and foremost a place to discover the virtuosity of our members, through the variety of their inspirations, the diversity of the challenges they face and the range of techniques they use. Prototypes, capsules, limited series, one-off pieces... Among these creations, we highlight those that are also the fruit of collaboration, where the hybridization of knowledge and know-how give rise to original, singular and exclusive pieces.</p>  <p>   <br>SET brings together our members' signature productions, emblematic of their creativity and technical mastery. LAB showcases the results of pioneering work, whose economic, aesthetic or societal potential is already fully expressed in a finished work. We would like to thank our partners and friends for their support, some of them through their invaluable testimonials. The adventure has only just begun, and we look forward to seeing you online, where you can regularly go behind the scenes of our members' workshops, studios or labs.</p>  <p> Discover our showroom (in French) </p>  <p>https://www.showroom.frenchcraftguild.fr/</p>
