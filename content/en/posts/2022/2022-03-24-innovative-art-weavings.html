    "Innovative Art Weavings"
  summary: >-
    <p>The French Craft organized a workshop "Innovative Art Weavings" on Thursday 24 March 2022 during the 3rd edition of Hotel&Lodge♦Meetings&Award, the international meeting of top hotel professionals.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>It is in the splendid setting of the Cambon Pavilion, among prestigious brands of hospitality and luxury catering, that the French Craft organized a session where Lucile Viaud and Lyse Drouaine, members of the association, came to present the fruit of their exceptional work around innovative art weavings. --------------- Light weaves Lyse Drouaine is an artist and founder of LUXDAWN®. Since its training in traditional weaving at the Esaa Duperré, it has developed an innovative material from textile fibres and optical fibres. A genuine turnkey solution for architects, decorators and designers, it is the result of the artist's research work between Lyon, Cité de la lumière (City of Light) and Aubusson, Cité de la tapisserie et des arts tissés (City of tapestry and woven arts). Innovative bright fabrics that sublimate exceptional places by combining with the beauty of materials the unique emotion of the experience. --------------- Glass weaving Aurelia Leblanc weaves exceptional yarns for haute couture, Lucile Viaud develops and manufactures his own recipes for natural glasses from locally available bio-resources. Their encounter was born a unique material, Confluence, a weaving of glass degrading the coloured variants of the lenses available according to the seasons. Dedicated to architecture, decoration and haute couture, their weaves are available from 2D to 3D on a range ranging from transparency to opacity, from flexibility to rigidity, through yarn variations and integration of unique modules. This discovery of art crafts through proposals combining traditional know-how and innovation gives all its meaning to the current quest for travellers wishing to experience a unique and authentic experience. Lyse Drouaine and Lucile Viaud illustrate the reinvention of the "hospitality" offer: ever more personalisation, social and environmental responsibility, immersive customer experience made of authenticity, heritage, culture... But, fortunately, they are not alone! All our members respond, on their scale and according to their art, to the need to relocate our productions and commercial opportunities for the know-how that only France can rely on, both on quality and quantity. Thanks to our partners  Thema Design  to have allowed this meeting which places the professions of gesture as full actors in the art of living in French.</p>
