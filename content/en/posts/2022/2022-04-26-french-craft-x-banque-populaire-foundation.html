    French Craft x Banque Populaire Foundation
  summary: >-
    <p>On April 26, 2022, the French Craft was invited to exchange with the winners of the Banque Populaire Foundation on the theme of intellectual property...</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>"Intellectual property as a lever for valuing its <br>creations" : the theme was posed, the exchanges were rich and the pleasure of being together evident.It was in 2013 that the Foundation chose to support the artisans of art by creating a specific jury, nod to the origins of the Banques Populaires. Artmakers are distinguished both by their aesthetic vision, their exceptional experimental abilities and a sense of matter acquired alongside a recognized art craftsman or through a solid training. They are smugglers of ancestral art techniques and trades, while being resolutely focused on creation, innovation or hybridization.Living in an art trade requires finding ways to settle in one's own workshop, acquire the materials or tools needed to make works, continue training or export to expand its reputation. In this way, the Foundation supports talented artisans who already have some experience of what is involved in creating a passion for a viable project. In addition to the Foundation's financial support, the members of the jury provide the winners with their network and experience.By bringing together their winners each year, the Banque Populaire Foundation offers the opportunity to exchange on common topics in order to support them a little more in their development.We were delighted to contribute to these meetings and to build valuable links with teams and winners!</p>  <p> Follow the Banque Populaire Foundation  <br>Website</p>  <p>https://www.fondationbanquepopulaire.fr/artisanat-d-art/</p>
