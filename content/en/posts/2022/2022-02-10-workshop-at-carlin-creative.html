    <p>  <br>"It is tempting, when you don't have a hammer as the only tool, to treat everything like a nail," Maslow said in 1966. Stimulating creativity and innovation is part of our mission. And one way to do this is to allow yourself to get out of the handlebar, broaden your horizons and confront your ideas with others.In partnership with CARLIN CREATIVE TREND OFFICE, we designed this collective intelligence workshop for our members. What a surprise when you know that Carlin is the world's first trend office (created by the Frenchman Fred Carlin in 1947!), active in 25 countries, serving a sustainable innovation through the trend books and methodologies they deploy for their customers. Thanks to our special promotion which has shown us that openness is the key to moving together towards desirable futures! Thanks to the sharp and exciting expertise of Edith Keller and Natalie Weinmann, and their kind advice!</p>
