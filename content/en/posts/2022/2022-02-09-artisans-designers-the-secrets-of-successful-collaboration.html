  summary: >-
    <p>On Tuesday, February 8, 2022, the French Craft and Artisans d'Avenir organized a meeting on the theme of fruitful collaborations between designers and artisans of art. An inspiring and friendly moment in the workshops of Procédés Chénel International, member of the French Craft.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On February 8, we had the pleasure of meeting with  Artisans d'Avenir  around a fundamental theme: fruitful collaborations between designers and artisans of art. Together, we have tried to understand how know-how and design can enrich themselves to create innovative works through their aesthetics and design. We talked about project development, creative process, techniques, meetings.</p>  <p>   <br>Aurelia Leblanc is weaver and textile designer. It highlights rare and exceptional materials thanks to weaving. Lucile Viaud is a research artist and member of the French Craft. She specializes in the formulation of glasses from natural resources. Together, they create the work Confluence, a hand-woven glass fabric, transparent, flexible and structured by an aquatic motif. Samuel Accoceberry is a designer, Bruce Cecere Is ironworks. Together, they form the SB26 duo since 2018 and explore metal. Together, they create new objects combining ancient and contemporary aesthetic know-how. Candle holders with futuristic shapes, delicate and aerial suspensions, tables with brutalist expression. A designer-artisan co-creation program is at the origin of  SB26 .</p>  <p>  "We were aiming for a dream of a material that is soft and light in glass. We had 3 to 4 years of research and development, alongside our respective activities. We have the same temporality, and a very complementary duet. We are valid together." <br>Aurélia Leblanc & Lucile Viaud <br>Aurelia Leblanc is a weaver and textile designer, Lucile Viaud is a research artist.</p>  <p>  "There's a lot of dialogue, exchanges. We played fairly easily because we had a common vocabulary from our previous experiences. After that, we're in the workshop, everything is there and we can easily join in inspirations and tastes. In expectations as the requirements." </p>  <p>Samuel Accoceberry is a designer, Bruce Cecere is an art ironmaker.</p>  <p>   <br>Thank you to our speakers and participants for this lively session! Thanks to Artisans d'Avenir for this fruitful collaboration! A big thank you to Sophie Chénel for welcoming us in the sumptuous showroom of  Procédés Chénel  !</p>  <p> REPLAY (in French)  <br>You can listen or re-listen to this meeting on the Artisans d'Avenir's podcast here. </p>  <p>VOIES, the podcast of Artisans d'Avenir</p>  <p>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/artisans-davenir/episodes/EP-38---Les-collaborations-fructueuses-entre-artisans-dart-et-designers-pointsdevue-avec-Lucile-Viaud--Aurelia-Leblanc--Samuel-Accoceberry--Bruce-Cecere-et-Magali-Lancien-avec-la-French-Craft-Guild-e1ecr86?mc_cid=a07286b5c2&mc_eid=c41ac6bdf5</p>
