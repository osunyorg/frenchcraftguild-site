    First “Augmented Co-creation” Workshop
  summary: >-
    <p>A look back at our first workshop dedicated to artificial intelligence, offered by French Craft and Jaùh.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On June 27, 2025, the first augmented co-creation workshop was held at  Procédés Chénel (French Craft). Led by Henri Danzin and Charles de Dainville ( Maison Jaùh // French Craft), this first workshop brought together six artisans and designers from very different backgrounds. The result? An intense, rich, and disruptive day that invited each participant to rethink their practice, question their craft, and reaffirm the importance of skill and creative ethics.  In an atmosphere that fostered emulation and kindness, this first session helped participants overcome their apprehensions and encouraged them to assert their uniqueness and explore new approaches, enriched by exchanges between creators.</p>  <p> Download the detailed program (in French)  <br>Programme Workshop "De l'IA à la co-création augmentée"</p>  <p>  "We were looking to see if these tools could be useful to us. We were able to understand the risks and opportunities in relation to our creative jobs, in this case the object design." <br>Julien Benayoun & William Boujon <br>Bold-design designers and co-founders</p>  <p>  "I have discovered concrete tools and their functionings that will help me think artistically, ethically and aesthetically about their use in my practice. " <br>Marion Saussier <br>Director General and Artist Bronzier d'Art at Maison Alovon</p>  <p>  "Reassuring, however, that intelligence is not intelligent, but only applies things that it has learned. I like the idea of putting myself in place of the machine to understand it and give it a framework. Intense but super rewarding." <br>Gregory Borach <br>Designer at Processes Chénel, independent designer and artist</p>  <p>  "It's very powerful. We are quickly seduced or lost. Mastering this tool will take longer than I imagined. The method of direct experimentation on its own universe is very relevant. The trainers are passionate and share their expertise without moderation. " <br>Frédéric Imbert <br>Project Developer at ARC (Mobilier national)</p>  <p>  "I saw that AI produced very aesthetic images, unreal lights, ethereal shapes, but far from matter. I couldn't imagine anything but realized its power of interpretation.</p>  <p>The idea of being able to constitute a vocabulary, a grammar of my own, was the most motivated element. Jaùh's team was very present for all of us</p>  <p>who came with different profiles. " <br>Anouchka Potdevin <br>Artisan metalwork, metal sculptor</p>  <p>  "I loved this workshop! It is so rewarding to share with other creative professions their questions, their visions. The practice time was long enough to be able to test several techniques and have an overview of the tool." <br>Morgan Pluchon <br>Industrial Designer</p>
