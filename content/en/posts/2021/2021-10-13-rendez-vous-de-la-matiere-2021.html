    <p>  <br>"Hybridation of know-how for the genesis of glass textile"Wednesday, 13 Octoberwith Lucile Viaud, founding designer Atelier Lucile Viaud - Ostraco® and Aurélia Leblanc, exceptional textile designer Aurelia Leblanc Textile Creation."Designer, Lucile Viaud, a graduate of Boule School, lives in Rennes. It produces its own glass recipes from local resources to value. An exceptional textile designer, Aurélia Leblanc trained in textile design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. Both have brought together their know-how and desire to innovate in craft techniques to give birth to the glass textile and the Confluence weaving project."</p>  <p>   <br>"Reuse as evidence"Tuesday, 12 Octoberwith Sophie Chénel, Managing Director Processes Chenel International - Paper Architecture, member of the French Craft; Frédéric Imbert, architect, founder Frédéric Imbert Studio ; Luc Delamain, co-founder architect SCAU."More than 10 million tonnes of materials were dumped in 2020 in the second sector alone according to the Ministry of Ecological Transition. The construction industry generates 40 million tonnes of waste per year, of which less than 1% is reused. While the margins for improvement are significant, re-use is on the rise and is no longer a debate. What is the contribution of craftsmen, architects and designers? Travel to the heart of inspiring initiatives."</p>  <p>   <br>"Innovative research for crafts"Wednesday, 13 Octoberwith Kevin Joly, i-Craft founder and Studio Invenio Flory"Kévin Joly, founder of I-Craft, has a conviction. The job of stone tailor is one of the very first appeared on Earth. Contrary to popular ideas, he does not die, he evolves. Technology is not there to replace it, but it opens the field of possibilities. For 10 years, Invenio Flory has created ornamental works between art, fashion and object. Still in motion, the studio stopped inventing the future of creation and crafts. Together, here we discuss the great tool that is the research innovation put at the service of craft industries."</p>  <p>   <br>"Renewed material: a new generation of materials"Wednesday, 13 Octoberwith Marine Bourgault, artisan of embroidery and textile design and Cyrile Deranlot, CEO of Daumet."Mixing traditional techniques and innovation, Marine Bourgault merges materials and creates a new common history. Whether it be wood, ceramic, glass, it embroiders matter, marries, combines, experiments and, by its approach, ennobles each matter with another. The company DAUMET is proposing a new generation of golds thanks to a new patented material and process technology that will reduce pressure on the precious metals resource. During this round table, we invite you to renew the material in all its forms and to discover its multiple fields of application."</p>  <p>   <br>« Glass and design, the secrets of a happy marriage »Wednesday, 13 Octoberwith Thomas Arnal, glass craftsman and artistic director La Compagnie du Verre and Flavia de Laubadère, founding designer STUDIO DE LAUBADERE."How do you design an object with two, when you don't do the same job? Flavia de Laubadère, designer, and Thomas Arnal, craftsman of the glass, invite us to the heart of the creative process that brings them together for the time of a common project. Glass is undeniably the core of the creation cell, but the complexity of its diversion is quickly raised, the challenges of the function of the object to come, the know-how that meet and the intrinsic values are affirmed. Zoom on an artistic as well as human adventure, probably made of talent, often intuition but always expertise."</p>  <p> REPLAYS (in French) The recording of these conferences was carried out under "live" conditions.
