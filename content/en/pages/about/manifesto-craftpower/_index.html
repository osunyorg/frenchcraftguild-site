    Manifesto
  summary: >-
    <p>Does French Craft exist? ”Craft” is the common term used to translate the French word ”Artisanat” in English. But its meaning is actually broader, its history richer , its legacy stronger.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>Excellence, creativity, fine craftsmanship  <br>   <br>Designers, artisans, journeymen, Best French Craftsman (MOF), living heritage companies (EPV)... We bring together the talents of yesterday, today and tomorrow, in all sectors, throughout France.Workshops, factories, studios, labs... every creative profession is welcomed within an open, dynamic and supportive community, working together to preserve our know-how and imagine those of tomorrow.</p>  <p> Business, culture, commitment  <br>   <br>France is the country where we multiply the value of everything, thanks to our creativity. It is our purpose, our art of living. Expressed through our know-how, it's a real common heritage that we need to nurture and promote.Encompassing both traditional and digital know-how, French Craft is a reminder that cultural and societal dimensions are just as important as the economic dimension.</p>  <p> Hybridization, transformation, impact  <br>   <br>Gathered around common know-how or projects, these trades interact and build communities that encourage emulation, transmission and solidarity. Attentive to their immediate environment, these communities in turn create goods that are rich in meaning and use, factors of social cohesion and territorial development, actively contributing to the common good.</p>  <p> Craftpower, our Manifesto  <br>   <br>Our manifesto develops the idea, while expressing a conviction, of the existence of a Craft “à la française”. From the atelier to the factory, from the studio to the lab, it's all about the love of gesture and excellence, as much as it is about inspiration and boundless creativity.For the French Craft Guild does exist to promote France's creative heritage.And to promote the extent of its powers.</p>  <p>   <br>Manifeste Craftpower (in French)</p>
