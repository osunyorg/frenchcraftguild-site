    <p>The French Craft Guild federates and promotes creators who combine know-how, innovation, creativity and design. By using our intangible cultural heritage as a lever for innovation and therefore added value, they contribute to the attractiveness and image of France, its companies, its brands, its territories and its products, in all sectors of activity.</p>

When it is more than a vital need, the act of purchase can become a delicate and permanent combination between what is useful, attractive, healthy, authentic, committed, even engaging. All these criteria affect the production chain to transform it into a value chain, requiring manufacturers to review their copy.The notion of the common good then reappears as a rallying point and, with it, the beautiful and authentic history, which creates an obvious and intimate relationship with its audience. Because it speaks of the love of gestures and excellence. Because it designates the source and the destination. Because it gives a common signature to the originality of each one. Because it reawakens the imperative need to protect and nurture this signature through constant adaptation to the challenges of today and tomorrow.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Daumet</p>  <p>   <br>In France, these beautiful stories exist for a long time, carried and forged by a fabric of actors very present and yet little visible.
