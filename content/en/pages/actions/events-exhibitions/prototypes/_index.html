    <p>  <br>Too many high-potential Craft projects remain untapped. Materials, forms, uses, processes...

At French Craft, we've been preoccupied with this subject for some time now, and we're working to bring out the development opportunities so that, tomorrow, these hybridized skills don't just remain ideas. The teaser is on!</p>
