    <p>  <br>Too many high-potential Craft projects remain untapped. Materials, forms, uses, processes... New models are already emerging, reflecting the dynamism of a new generation of craftsmen, designers and entrepreneurs who are more eco-conscious, more narrative, more committed. They work across disciplines towards a common goal. At French Craft, we've been preoccupied with this subject for some time now, and we're working to bring out the development opportunities so that, tomorrow, these hybridized skills don't just remain ideas.</p>  <p> Discover the event </p>  <p>https://prototype.frenchcraftguild.fr/en</p>
