In 2023, they founded the publishing house JAÙH. Henri Danzin:  He spent nearly 18 years working in new technologies as an entrepreneur. He combines technical mastery of digital tools with a passion for contemporary design and generative art. Charles de Dainville:  Charles spent 15 years at the head of an agency specializing in furniture and scenography for brands. He brings rigorous training in furniture design and a culture of traditional craftsmanship. About JAUH - Algorithmic Furniture Founded in March 2023, JAÙH is a furniture design studio that explores the boundaries between generative algorithms and artisanal craftsmanship. Our experimental approach involves integrating algorithms as true creative partners in our collaborations with Poitou carpenters. We develop what we call "algorithmic furniture" - a new approach to generative design where algorithms feed our forms and grammars, enriching our creative process, gestures, and materials, without ever replacing the craftsman or designer. This method allows us to explore the creative "uncanny valley," generating familiar yet subtly offbeat forms that challenge our perceptual habits. At JAÙH, we design less finished objects than generative systems that enable the manufacture of our unique pieces. Each creation is born from a constant dialogue between algorithmic exploration and traditional know-how, embodying a vision of design where technology and craftsmanship enrich each other.  </p>  <p> Interested by this workshop? </p>  <p>Write us <br>mailto:contact@frenchcraftguild.fr</p>  <p> Webconference (in French)  <br>Discover the basics of the general AI and a first approach to the Krea tool.
